## Quick Orientation (read in 60 seconds)

**What is happening:**
We are migrating `feat/android-callkeep-core-process-migration` into `develop`
via 23 atomic PRs. The feature isolates Android `PhoneConnectionService`
into a separate `:callkeep_core` OS process.

**Where is the full plan:** `MIGRATION_PLAN.md` (this repo root, this branch)

**Current overall phase:** Planning complete. No PRs opened yet.

**Next action to take:** Wave 1 — open all of these simultaneously:
PR-1, PR-2a, PR-2b, PR-2c, PR-2d, PR-2e, PR-3, PR-4a, PR-4b, PR-4d
(all independent, no prerequisites).

## Decisions Log

Decisions already made — do not re-litigate without strong reason.

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-03-13 | Do NOT merge deletions of `AGENTS.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `lefthook.yml`, `.claude/hooks/`, `tool/scripts/` from feature branch | These files were deleted in the feature prototype but must stay on `develop` |
| 2026-03-13 | Do NOT merge `.claude/settings.local.json` files | Local-only, should not be committed |
| 2026-03-13 | Split PR-9 into PR-9a (transport) + PR-9b (manifest) | Core decomposition principle: cross-process mechanisms work in-process; migrate transport first while still single-process, then the manifest change becomes trivial |
| 2026-03-13 | `ConnectionsApi` switches to `MainProcessConnectionTracker` in PR-6, not PR-9 | Tracker is already the cross-process-safe read path; doing it early keeps PR-9b minimal |
| 2026-03-13 | docs/ in PR-3 should carry a "planned architecture" warning header | docs describe dual-process which isn't on develop yet when PR-3 lands |
| 2026-03-13 | Split PR-2 into 2a-2e (one fix = one PR) | Smaller scope = faster review, easier revert, cleaner history |
| 2026-03-13 | Split PR-4 into 4a-4d (one utility concern = one PR) | Same principle — additive changes are independent, split reduces risk |
| 2026-03-13 | Split PR-5 into 5a-5e (one test file = one PR) | Tests are fully independent; splitting enables parallel merges |
| 2026-03-13 | Split PR-7 into 7a (ForegroundService) + 7b (IncomingCallService) | Different components, different risk profiles, different reviewers |
| 2026-03-13 | PR-6 kept as one unit (Tracker + ConnectionManager) | Tightly coupled — tracker IS what manager reads; splitting would leave dangling dependencies |
| 2026-03-13 | PR-8 kept as one unit (all Pigeon files) | Dart/Kotlin Pigeon files must always be regenerated and merged together |

## Open Questions (resolve before the relevant PR)

| Question | Relevant PR | Status |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| Commit `2620715` labeled "tmp" — verify actual content before porting | PR-2e | **open** — run `git show 2620715` |
| PR-1 may be already done by `344b9d5` — check delta first | PR-1 | **open** — run `git diff develop -- '*/analysis_options.yaml'` |
| CI/CD workflow changes on feature branch — include or skip? | PR-1 or skip | **open** |
| Exact fields added to `CallMetaData.kt`? | PR-4c | **open** — run `git show 6af63bd -- '*CallMetaData.kt'` |
| `StorageDelegate` existing keys on develop — conflict risk? | PR-4a | **open** — read current `StorageDelegate.kt` on develop |
| `RetryManager` — does it reference `StorageDelegate`? (affects PR-5a prerequisite) | PR-5a | **open** |

## How to Resume Work in a New Session

1. Read this file top-to-bottom (2 min).
2. Check **PR Status** table — find the first `not started` PR.
3. Run `git log --oneline develop..feat/android-callkeep-core-process-migration`
   to confirm feature branch is still ahead.
4. Read the PR spec in `MIGRATION_PLAN.md` for the target PR.
5. Check **Open Questions** — resolve any that block the target PR.
6. Create the branch from latest `develop`:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop && git pull
   git checkout -b <branch-name-from-plan>
   ```
7. Extract only the relevant files from feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout feat/android-callkeep-core-process-migration -- <file1> <file2>
   ```
8. Verify, push, open PR targeting `develop`.
9. After merge: update **Branch Heads**, **PR Status**, and **Open Questions**
   in this file, commit the update to `feat/android-callkeep-core-process-migration`.

## Gotchas & Tribal Knowledge

- **Never** `git merge feat/android-callkeep-core-process-migration` wholesale
  — the feature branch deletes repo-wide tooling files.
- Always cherry-pick / extract individual files, never the full branch.
- When extracting Pigeon-related files, always extract the full set together:
  `pigeons/callkeep.messages.dart` + `Generated.kt` + `callkeep.pigeon.dart`
  + `converters.dart`. They must stay in sync.
- `analysis_options.yaml` was already touched in `344b9d5` on develop — diff
  carefully before PR-1 to avoid duplicating a change that's already there.
- The `webtrit_callkeep/test/webtrit_callkeep_test.dart` was deleted on the
  feature branch — do NOT carry that deletion to develop.
- Broadcast receivers for `ConnectionPerform` events use `applicationContext`
  — using an Activity context will silently fail cross-process.
