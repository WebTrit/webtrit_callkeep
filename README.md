# Webtrit CallKeep

**Webtrit CallKeep** is a Flutter plugin that integrates native calling UI on iOS (CallKit) and Android (
ConnectionService). It allows your VoIP/WebRTC app to display incoming/outgoing calls using the device‚Äôs system UI ‚Äî
even when your app is in the background or terminated.

> **Note**: CallKit is banned in the China App Store. For distribution in China, consider using an alternative mechanism
> such as standard local notifications with sound.

---

## ‚úÖ Features

- **Incoming Call UI**\
  ‚Äì On iOS, the system CallKit UI is shown when the app is locked or in the background. When the app is in the
  foreground, a Flutter-based incoming call screen is used instead.\
  ‚Äì On Android, all incoming calls are displayed using a Flutter UI combined with the standard push notification
  interface ‚Äî native ConnectionService UI is not used.

- **Background Handling**\
  ‚Äì On iOS, background incoming calls are handled via CallKit and PushKit.\
  ‚Äì On Android, background call handling is supported either via persistent signaling services or triggered by push
  notifications (e.g., FCM).

- **Incoming & Outgoing Calls**\
  ‚Äì Full support for both call directions

- **Call Controls**\
  ‚Äì Answer, decline, mute, hold, and dial pad (DTMF), with delegate event handling

## üîÑ Event Communication Between Flutter and Platform

Webtrit CallKeep provides a robust two-way communication system between the Flutter layer and native platforms (iOS and
Android), inspired by the CallKit design on iOS.

---

### üì§ Events Sent from Flutter to Platform

The following methods are used to **notify the native platform** about call actions or state changes. These are
typically used to **trigger UI** (e.g., incoming screen), report call status, or request platform-level operations.

| Method                              | Description                                                                         |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `reportNewIncomingCall(...)`        | Triggers the native UI to display an incoming call.                                 |
| `reportConnectingOutgoingCall(...)` | Reports that an outgoing call is connecting.                                        |
| `reportConnectedOutgoingCall(...)`  | Reports that an outgoing call is connected.                                         |
| `reportUpdateCall(...)`             | Sends updated call metadata such as display name, video, or proximity sensor usage. |
| `reportEndCall(...)`                | Notifies the platform that a call has ended with a reason.                          |
| `startCall(...)`                    | Starts an outgoing call via native UI.                                              |
| `answerCall(...)`                   | Answers a call from Flutter code.                                                   |
| `endCall(...)`                      | Ends the call from Flutter.                                                         |
| `setHeld(...)`                      | Puts the call on hold or resumes it.                                                |
| `setMuted(...)`                     | Mutes or unmutes the call.                                                          |
| `sendDTMF(...)`                     | Sends a DTMF tone.                                                                  |
| `setSpeaker(...)`                   | Enables or disables speaker mode.                                                   |

### üì• `perform*` Events Received from Platform

These methods are called from the **native platform back to Flutter** when a user interacts with the system‚Äôs call UI (
e.g., answering a call from lock screen) or when system-level events occur (e.g., audio session activation).

Implement these by providing a `CallkeepDelegate` via `Callkeep().setDelegate(...)`.

| Method                         | Triggered When...                                                          |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `continueStartCallIntent(...)` | System confirms outgoing call intent (e.g., from Siri or Call UI).         |
| `didPushIncomingCall(...)`     | System has received and processed an incoming call.                        |
| `performStartCall(...)`        | User initiates an outgoing call from native UI.                            |
| `performAnswerCall(...)`       | User answers the call from native UI.                                      |
| `performEndCall(...)`          | User ends the call from system UI.                                         |
| `performSetHeld(...)`          | User toggles hold/resume from system UI.                                   |
| `performSetMuted(...)`         | User toggles mute from system UI.                                          |
| `performSendDTMF(...)`         | User sends DTMF digits from the native dial pad.                           |
| `performSetSpeaker(...)`       | User enables/disables speaker from system UI.                              |
| `didActivateAudioSession()`    | System has activated the audio session (important for audio routing).      |
| `didDeactivateAudioSession()`  | System has deactivated the audio session.                                  |
| `didReset()`                   | System resets the call state, often due to errors or forceful termination. |

> üßê **Note**: `perform*` methods usually require you to respond asynchronously (e.g., via signaling servers) and return
> a `bool` indicating success or failure. Failing to respond may result in incorrect UI behavior or system timeouts.

### Example: `startCall` ‚ûù `performStartCall`

Below is a simplified lifecycle flow illustrating how an outgoing call is initiated and processed using
`Callkeep.startCall` followed by a native event triggering `performStartCall`:

```dart
// Triggered by your Flutter app logic
final callId = WebtritSignalingClient.generateCallId();
final handle = CallkeepHandle.number('+123456789');
await callkeep.startCall(
  callId,
  handle,
  displayNameOrContactIdentifier: 'John Doe',
  hasVideo: false,
);
```

This will attempt to establish a new connection and validate it. If the connection is successfully created and valid,
the system will invoke `performStartCall` to proceed with the call setup.

If the connection is valid, the system will call the following delegate method:

```dart
@override
Future<bool> performStartCall(
  String callId,
  CallkeepHandle handle,
  String? displayNameOrContactIdentifier,
  bool video,
) async {
  // Establish media connection and signaling offer
  final stream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({'audio': true});
  final peerConnection = await createPeerConnection({...});
  final offer = await peerConnection.createOffer();

  await _signalingClient.send(OutgoingCallRequest(
    callId: callId,
    number: handle.normalizedValue(),
    jsep: offer.toMap(),
  ));

  await peerConnection.setLocalDescription(offer);
  return true;
}
```

You are expected to:

1. Initialize media stream
2. Create WebRTC offer
3. Send offer to your signaling server
4. Set local description on the peer connection

If everything succeeds, return `true`. If anything fails, return `false` and CallKeep will automatically terminate the
native call screen.

---

You can add similar flows for `answerCall`, `endCall`, etc.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Initialization (Main Isolate)

```dart
await _callkeep.setUp(
  CallkeepOptions(
    ios: CallkeepIOSOptions(
      localizedName: context.read<PackageInfo>().appName,
      ringtoneSound: Assets.ringtones.incomingCall1,
      ringbackSound: Assets.ringtones.outgoingCall1,
      iconTemplateImageAssetName: Assets.callkeep.iosIconTemplateImage.path,
      maximumCallGroups: 13,
      maximumCallsPerCallGroup: 13,
      supportedHandleTypes: const {CallkeepHandleType.number},
    ),
    android: CallkeepAndroidOptions(
      ringtoneSound: Assets.ringtones.incomingCall1,
      ringbackSound: Assets.ringtones.outgoingCall1,
    ),
  ),
);
```

### Setting Delegates

The plugin allows you to register delegate classes to handle call-related events.

```dart
Callkeep().setDelegate(MyCallkeepDelegate());
Callkeep().setPushRegistryDelegate(MyPushRegistryDelegate()); // iOS only
```

- `setDelegate(...)`: Listen to call events (incoming, answered, ended, etc.) entirely on the Flutter side.
- `setPushRegistryDelegate(...)`: Handle PushKit VoIP push events on iOS only.

---

### Receiving Incoming Call

```dart
await Callkeep().reportNewIncomingCall(
  callId,
  CallkeepHandle.number('+123456789'),
  displayName: 'Caller Name',
  hasVideo: false,
);
```

### Starting Outgoing Call

```dart
await Callkeep().startCall(
  'outgoing-id',
  CallkeepHandle.number('+987654321'),
  displayNameOrContactIdentifier: 'Jane Doe',
  hasVideo: true,
);
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Android Background Modes

Webtrit CallKeep offers two modes to handle background call signaling in Android. Use the one that suits your scenario.

> üîé **Note**: Some Android classes use the `@Keep` annotation to prevent code shrinking and obfuscation. Ensure
> ProGuard/R8 rules preserve these classes.

---

### ‚ôªÔ∏è 1. Push Notification Isolate (One-time)

Ideal for apps that **do not maintain a persistent connection** and instead rely on push notifications to trigger call
events.

#### Setup

Configure the push notification isolate with the following code (Optional):

```dart
AndroidCallkeepServices.backgroundPushNotificationBootstrapService.configurePushNotificationSignalingService(launchBackgroundIsolateEvenIfAppIsOpen: false);
```

Initialize the push notification isolate callback.
This callback will be triggered when
`AndroidCallkeepServices.backgroundPushNotificationBootstrapService.reportNewIncomingCall` is called, for example, from
an FCM isolate.

```dart
AndroidCallkeepServices.backgroundPushNotificationBootstrapService.initializeCallback(onPushNotificationSyncCallback););
```

#### Triggering Incoming Call from FCM or Another Isolate

You can notify the plugin of a new incoming call from within a background handler (e.g., FCM):

```dart
@pragma('vm:entry-point')
Future<void> _firebaseMessagingBackgroundHandler(RemoteMessage message) async {
  AndroidCallkeepServices.backgroundPushNotificationBootstrapService.reportNewIncomingCall(
    appNotification.call.id,
    CallkeepHandle.number(appNotification.call.handle),
    displayName: appNotification.call.displayName,
    hasVideo: appNotification.call.hasVideo,
  );
}
```

#### Initialize push notification callback

To manage resources and synchronize signaling from push notifications, implement a background callback like this:

```dart
@pragma('vm:entry-point')
Future<void> onPushNotificationCallback(CallkeepPushNotificationSyncStatus status) async {
  await _initializeDependencies();

  switch (status) {
    case CallkeepPushNotificationSyncStatus.synchronizeCallStatus:
      await _backgroundCallEventManager?.onStart();
      break;
    case CallkeepPushNotificationSyncStatus.releaseResources:
      await _backgroundCallEventManager?.close();
      break;
  }
}
```

Inside this isolate, when a connection is established, we can communicate with the native part using
`BackgroundPushNotificationServicee`. This service provides methods for `endBackgroundCall`, and
`endAllBackgroundCalls`. Additionally, you can set a delegate using `setBackgroundServiceDelegate` to listen for events
such as `performServiceAnswerCall`, `performServiceEndCall`, and `endCallReceived`.

```dart
class SignalingForegroundIsolateManager implements CallkeepBackgroundServiceDelegate {
  @override
  void performServiceAnswerCall(String callId) async {
    if (!(await _signalingManager.hasNetworkConnection())) {
      throw Exception('No connection');
    }
    // Proceed with answering
  }

  @override
  void performServiceEndCall(String callId) async {
    await _signalingManager.declineCall(callId);
  }
  
  void anwserCall(String callId) {
    BackgroundPushNotificationServicee.answerCall(callId);
  }
}
```

This ensures your app can rehydrate or tear down background services based on the nature of the push event.

---

### üîå 2. Background Signaling Isolate (Persistent)

Used for always-on signaling, even in the background.

#### Setup

Configure the signaling isolate and set up the notification details for the foreground service(Optional).

```dart
AndroidCallkeepServices.backgroundSignalingBootstrapService.setUp(androidNotificationName: "WebTrit Inbound Calls",androidNotificationDescription: "This is required to receive incoming calls",);
```

Initialize the isolate callback for background signaling. This callback will be triggered when the status of the main
isolate changes, the app lifecycle changes, or the isolate starts:

```dart
AndroidCallkeepServices.backgroundSignalingBootstrapService.initializeCallback(onSignalingSyncCallback);
```

#### Start and stop the foreground signaling service from the main isolate:

```dart
await AndroidCallkeepServices.backgroundSignalingBootstrapService.startService();
await AndroidCallkeepServices.backgroundSignalingBootstrapService.stopService();
```

#### Initialize signaling callback

Register the callback that will be triggered to manage the signaling connection.
This can be done using the `CallkeepLifecycleEvent` from `CallkeepServiceStatus`, which contains parameters such as the
current activity status (e.g., opened or closed) and the `CallkeepSignalingStatus` from `CallkeepServiceStatus`,
indicating the current signaling status if provided by the main isolate; otherwise, it will be null.

```dart
@pragma('vm:entry-point')
Future<void> onSignalingSyncCallback(CallkeepServiceStatus status) async {
  await _initializeDependencies();

  await _signalingForegroundIsolateManager?.sync(status);
  
  return;
}

```

Inside this isolate, when a connection is established, we can communicate with the native part using
`BackgroundSignalingService`. This service provides methods for `incomingCall`, `endBackgroundCall`, and
`endAllBackgroundCalls`. Additionally, you can set a delegate using `setBackgroundServiceDelegate` to listen for events
such as `performServiceAnswerCall`, `performServiceEndCall`, and `endCallReceived`.

```dart
class SignalingForegroundIsolateManager implements CallkeepBackgroundServiceDelegate {
  @override
  void performServiceAnswerCall(String callId) async {
    if (!(await _signalingManager.hasNetworkConnection())) {
      throw Exception('No connection');
    }
    // Proceed with answering
  }

  @override
  void performServiceEndCall(String callId) async {
    await _signalingManager.declineCall(callId);
  }
  
  void anwserCall(String callId) {
    BackgroundSignalingService.answerCall(callId);
  }
}
```
